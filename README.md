### Hello everyone 👋:man:🖥️ 


I'm __Randy__. I am a :snake: Python Developer with experience in working with Sphinx & MkDocs and building extensions for both Sphinx & MkDocs. I also develop web apps and RESTful API using Flask.

Right now, I'm happy working in the Docs-as-Code ecosystem.

I am passionate about learning new things and sharing ideas with both engineers and non-engineers. Also, I write about my opinions and knowledge on my [:link: blog site](https://isolveit.hashnode.dev).

Currently, I am learning about Embedded systems using Raspberry Pi 4 Module with Python and Mobile app development with Flutter.
Also, I am fascinated by drone technology and aspire to become a professional drone pilot.

I appreciate a company environment that supports workers, creates room for innovation, and encourages teamwork.
