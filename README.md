### Hi GitHub User 👋:man:🖥️,


I'm __Randy__ but you can call me __i SOLve IT__. I am a :snake: Python Developer with experience in working with Sphinx & MkDocs and building extensions for both Sphinx & MkDocs. I also develop web apps and RESTful API using Flask.

Right now, I'm happy working in the Docs-as-Code ecosystem.

I am passionate about learning new things and sharing ideas with both engineers and non-engineers. Also, I write about my opinions and knowledge on my [:link: blog site](https://isolveit.hashnode.dev).

Currently, I am learning about Embedded systems using Raspberry Pi 4 Module with Python and Mobile app development with Flutter.
Also, I am fascinated by drone technology and aspire to become a professional drone pilot.

I appreciate a company environment that supports workers, creates room for innovation, and encourages teamwork.

📫 To know more about the work I do, feel free to go through my GitHub repositories and also visit my [Twitter 🐦](https://twitter.com/iam_randyduodu) or [LinkedIn :link:](https://www.linkedin.com/in/randy-duodu/) profiles.
