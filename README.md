### Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹ :octocat: :smile: 


:man::computer: I'm __Randy__. I am a :snake: Python Developer with experience in working with Sphinx & MkDocs and building extensions for both Sphinx & MkDocs. I also develop web apps and RESTful API using Flask.

I am fascinated by drone technology and aspire to become a professional drone pilot.

I am passionate about learning new things and sharing ideas with both engineers and non-engineers. Also, I write about my opinions and knowledge on my [:link: blog site](https://isolveit.hashnode.dev).

I appreciate a company environment that supports workers, creates room for innovation, and encourages teamwork.
